## Features

- **Comprehensive Testing:**  
  Covers basket, favorites, filters, product details, search, and more.
- **Test Parameterization:**  
  Tests are parameterized to run with various data sets, increasing flexibility and coverage.
- **Parallel Execution:**  
  Tests run in parallel to optimize execution time. By default, tests use **3 workers**.
- **Special Handling for Basket Tests:**  
  Basket tests run on a single worker (`--workers=1`) to ensure stability due to shared user state.
- **CI Ready:**  
  Integrated GitHub Actions workflow supports dynamic test selection (by suite or tag).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trin-trinity/ispace-e2e-tests.git
   cd ispace-e2e-tests
   ```

   ```

> [!NOTE]  
> The `postinstall` script automatically installs the required Playwright browsers.

## Configuration
**TypeScript & Path Aliases**

The project uses a tsconfig.json file to manage TypeScript settings and simplify module imports. For example:
 ```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["app/components/*"],
      "@fragments/*": ["app/fragments/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["app/pages/*"],
      "@api/*": ["app/api/*"],
      "@helpers/*": ["helpers/*"],
      "@data/*": ["data/*"],
      "@fixtures/*": ["tests/fixtures/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}

```
**Environment Variables**

Before running tests, ensure that the following environment variables are configured (via a .env file or your CI environment):
- BASE_URL
- EMAIL
- PASSWORD

## Usage

**Running All Tests**

To run all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

**Running Specific Test Suites**

The project defines dedicated npm scripts for each suite:
- Basket Tests (Single Worker):
```bash
npm run test:basket
```
- Favorites Tests:
```bash
npm run test:favorites
```
- Filters Tests:
```bash
npm run test:filters
```

- Product Details Tests:
```bash
npm run test:productDetails
```

- Search Tests:
```bash
npm run test:search
```
_Example package.json scripts section:_
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "npx playwright test",
    "test:basket": "npx playwright test basket.test.ts --workers=1",
    "test:others": "npx playwright test --grep-invert \"@basket\"",
    "test:favorites": "npx playwright test favorites.test.ts",
    "test:filters": "npx playwright test filters.test.ts",
    "test:productDetails": "npx playwright test productDetails.test.ts",
    "test:search": "npx playwright test search.test.ts",
    "show-report": "npx playwright show-report",
    "postinstall": "npx playwright install --with-deps",
    "test:tag:loggedUser": "npx playwright test --grep \"@loggedUser\"",
    "test:tag:basket": "npx playwright test --grep \"@basket\" --workers=1"
  },
```

**Running Tests by Tag**

You can filter tests by tags using commands. For example:

- Basket Tag (Single Worker):
```bash
npm run test:tag:basket
```

- 	Logged User Tag:
```bash
npm run test:tag:loggedUser
```

## Continuous Integration
The project includes a playwright.yml GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow supports:
- Dynamic Test Selection:
Choose between running tests by suite or by tag via dropdown inputs when manually triggering the workflow.
- Conditional Jobs:
Only the jobs that match the selected suite or tag run, keeping the CI output focused and streamlined.
- Artifact Upload:
Test reports are uploaded as artifacts for easy review.

_Key options in the workflow include:_
- **runBy**: Choose between ‚Äúsuite‚Äù and ‚Äútag‚Äù.
- **suite**: Select a test suite (basket, favorites, filters, productDetails, search, or all).
- **tag**: Select a test tag (basket, loggedUser, or none).
